#  𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 🧼✨🐍

my first Python data cleaning project using 𝑷𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒂𝒔!

In this project, I worked on:
 • Handling missing values
 • Fixing incorrect data types
 • Checking for duplicates
 • Cleaning categorical columns (removing extra spaces)
 • Merging related columns

Now the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis 💪

It was a great learning experience — improving my skills in data preprocessing and understanding the importance of clean data before analysis.

🚀 See you in my next project!
